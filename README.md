## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Google OAuth credentials (for Google Sign-In)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod download
```

3. Create a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example` if available):
```env
PORT=8080
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-in-production
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRY=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRY=168h
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8080/api/auth/google/callback
```

4. Run the backend server:
```bash
go run main.go
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

### Google OAuth Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **Google+ API** (or **Google People API** if Google+ is deprecated)
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Application type: **Web application**
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins**:
     - `http://localhost:5173` (for local development)
     - `https://g04-react-email-client.vercel.app` (for Vercel deployment)
     - `https://g04-react-email-client.onrender.com` (for Render deployment)
   - **Authorized redirect URIs**:
     - `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/google/callback` (for local backend)
     - `[YOUR_BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL]/api/auth/google/callback` (for deployed backend, if applicable)
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** to your `.env` files in both backend and frontend as shown above.

### IMAP Test Accounts

> **Note:** This project does **not** use real IMAP accounts. The backend provides a mock email API with realistic sample data. No IMAP setup is required.

### Simulating Token Expiry (for Demo)

To demonstrate token refresh and expiry handling:
- **Option 1:** In your backend `.env`, set `JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRY` to a short value (e.g., `30s` or `1m`). Restart the backend. Login, then wait for the access token to expire and observe the automatic refresh.
- **Option 2:** Use browser dev tools to manually remove or edit the access token in memory (if accessible) to simulate expiry.
- **Option 3:** Temporarily modify the backend code to force token expiry for testing purposes.

## Token Storage Strategy

### Access Token
- **Storage**: In-memory (JavaScript variable)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Access tokens are short-lived (15 minutes)
  - Storing in-memory reduces XSS attack surface
  - Automatically cleared when the page is closed/refreshed
  - More secure than localStorage for sensitive tokens
  - Prevents token theft via XSS attacks since JavaScript cannot access in-memory variables from other scripts

### Refresh Token
- **Storage**: localStorage
- **Rationale**:
  - Refresh tokens are long-lived (7 days)
  - Needed to persist across page refreshes to maintain user session
  - Allows "remember me" functionality without requiring re-authentication
  - While localStorage is vulnerable to XSS, the refresh token is only used server-side for token refresh
  - The refresh token is validated server-side before generating new access tokens
  - On logout, refresh token is cleared from both localStorage and server storage
  - If refresh fails (expired/invalid), tokens are cleared and user is redirected to login

### Security Considerations
- Access tokens are never stored in localStorage, reducing XSS risk
- Refresh tokens are validated server-side before use
- Automatic token refresh handles expiry gracefully with concurrency protection
- Failed refresh attempts trigger logout (clear tokens) and redirect to login
- CORS is configured to allow frontend-backend communication
- Tokens are cleared on logout from both client and server

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Email/password login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/google` - Google OAuth sign-in
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh access token
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout (invalidate refresh token)

### Email (Protected)
- `GET /api/emails/mailboxes` - Get all mailboxes
- `GET /api/emails/mailboxes/:id` - Get mailbox by ID
- `GET /api/emails/mailboxes/:id/emails` - Get emails in mailbox
- `GET /api/emails/:id` - Get email details
- `PATCH /api/emails/:id/read` - Mark email as read
- `PATCH /api/emails/:id/star` - Toggle email star

## Usage

1. **Sign Up / Sign In**:
   - Navigate to `/login` or `/signup`
   - Enter credentials or use Google Sign-In
   - Upon successful authentication, you'll be redirected to `/inbox`

2. **Email Dashboard**:
   - **Column 1 (Left)**: Mailbox list (Inbox, Starred, Sent, Drafts, etc.)
   - **Column 2 (Center)**: Email list for selected mailbox
   - **Column 3 (Right)**: Email detail view
   - Click on any email to view details
   - Use star button to mark emails as starred
   - Responsive design: on mobile, shows list or detail view with back button

3. **Logout**:
   - Click the logout button in the header
   - Both access and refresh tokens are cleared

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment

The backend can be deployed to any Go-compatible hosting service:

1. **Build the binary**:
```bash
cd backend
go build -o server main.go
```

2. **Set environment variables** on your hosting platform

3. **Run the server**:
```bash
./server
```

### Frontend Deployment

**Frontend**: https://your-app.netlify.app (or your deployment URL)
**Backend**: https://your-api.herokuapp.com (or your backend URL)

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests (if implemented)
cd backend
go test ./...

# Frontend tests (if implemented)
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Code Structure

- **Backend**: Follows modular Clean Architecture
  - `cmd/api`: transport/bootstrap layer (Gin server + routes)
  - `internal/<module>`: feature modules (auth, email) split into delivery / domain / dto / repository / usecase
  - `pkg/config`: shared configuration loader accessible across layers
  - Repositories are in-memory now but can be swapped for persistent stores without touching delivery/usecases

- **Frontend**: Modular component-based architecture
  - Pages: Top-level route components
  - Components: Reusable UI components
  - Services: API communication layer
  - Store: Global state management
  - Types: TypeScript type definitions

## Third-Party Services

- **Google OAuth**: For Google Sign-In functionality
  - Setup: https://console.cloud.google.com/
  - Documentation: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2

## This Week's Requirements (Implemented)

The project has been updated to satisfy this week's assignment requirements. Key implemented items:

- Kanban UI with 4 configurable columns (Inbox, To Do, Done, Snoozed) as implemented in the frontend (KanbanPage / KanbanBoard).
- Cards display real email data fetched from the backend and include sender, subject, and a preview snippet.
- Drag & drop support: cards can be moved between columns and the backend state is updated on drop.
- Snooze feature: moving an email to the `snoozed` column sets a snooze timer (24 hours by default) and hides the card from active columns until wake-up.
- Wake-up logic: snoozed emails are programmatically restored to the Inbox after the snooze period (implemented for both mock/local emails and provider-backed mail via in-memory timers).
- Gemini (LLM) integration: the backend calls an LLM service to generate dynamic email summaries which are displayed in the UI (detail view / card summary).
- IMAP support: basic IMAP provider logic is implemented to allow logging in with IMAP accounts and fetching messages across mailbox types. IMAP message IDs are encoded and resolved so that `GetEmailByID` works for IMAP-style IDs.

Note: IMAP and provider-backed kanban state (for Gmail/IMAP) currently uses in-memory maps for this assignment. For production, persist snooze/kanban state so it survives server restarts.

## Grading Rubric (Scoring Criteria)

Feature | Scoring Criteria | Max Points
---|---:|---:
I | • The UI displays a board with separate configurable columns (for example: Inbox, To Do, Done).

  • Cards show real email data retrieved from the backend (must include Sender, Subject, and a content snippet).

  • The layout is organized and visually readable (Kanban style). | 25
II | • User can successfully drag a card from one column to another.

  • Dropping a card triggers a backend update to change the email's state.

  • The UI updates the card's position immediately without a full page reload. | 25
III | • The "Snooze" action correctly hides/removes a card from its active column (e.g., Inbox).

  • The card is successfully moved to the "Snoozed" column/state.

  • Logic is implemented to "wake" (restore) the email to the active view after the configured time has elapsed. | 25
IV | • The backend successfully sends real email text to the processing API (LLM or library).

  • The system returns a dynamically generated summary (no hard-coded or mocked summary text).

  • The summary is clearly displayed on the card or in the detail view. | 25

**Total** || **100**

If you'd like, I can also add a short "Quick Testing" subsection that explains how to temporarily shorten the snooze duration for manual testing (e.g., set to a few seconds), plus example curl commands to snooze and verify the wake-up behavior.
